Run this command, it will take a while (5-10 minutes):

   rbenv install 2.7.4

Then restart your terminal again (close it and reopen it). then run:

    ruby -v

Once ruby is installed run this code in your terminal:

    ruby robot_challenge.rb
    
Once you input X, Y and F, now you can access to a set of commands:

MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT, REPORT, PLACE and QUIT GAME
